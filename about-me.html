                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                        I’m a UX Designer in the Houston area with special interests in <u>user research</u>, <u>accessible design</u>, and <u>front-end development</u>. I finished a boot camp certificate course with Rice University in April of 2023 and can’t wait to get my career up and running!

                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                        Throughout my time as an educator, I deeply enjoyed helping my students learn and grow. And it’s this very same passion for people that initially led me to pursue UX Design. As I continue down this path, I hope that my career is defined by the accessibility and usability of the designs I create.

                        It's a moniker that I created for my personal brand using the names of my beloved pets! Since they have been with me through thick and thin, I thought it fitting to honor them in my portfolio.

                        <bdi class="orange">Artemis</bdi> has been with me since my sophomore year of college. She was named after the Greek goddess of the hunt and wilderness and is represented by the archer at the center of the logo. This cat is a special one. She loves finding comfy spots to curl up in, sitting outside in the sun, and giving me hugs. I don't know where I would be without her gentle and comforting presence.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                        <bdi class="orange">Iris</bdi> was a pandemic puppy and one of the best decisions I have ever made. She was named after the Greek goddess of rainbows but is also, as I call her, a delicate flower. You can usually find Iris curled up on her favorite spot: directly on top of the loveseat cushion. She also enjoys playing with her baby brother (Lucky), racing through the forest, and getting ear scritches.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                        <bdi class="orange">Lucky</bdi> is the most recent edition to the family. As his name suggests, he is most definitely a very lucky boy. He's a parvo survivor, a former shelter pup, and a true lover of life. From the moment we brought him home, he fit right in. On any given day, Lucky can be found chewing on his favorite toys, chasing his big sister through the woods, swimming, or taking a nap wedged between the couch cushions.
